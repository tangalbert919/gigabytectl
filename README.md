# gigabytectl for Gigabyte Aero/AORUS laptops

This repository primarily serves as a hub for programs developed for use on Gigabyte's Aero/AORUS laptops. All of them are needed to ensure proper functionality.

If you intend to contribute to this project, it is recommended that you instead clone the individual repositories themselves. Otherwise, you can simply download this one.

## Goals
* Complete RGB keyboard support in Control Center
* Merge kernel driver into the Linux kernel itself
* Get custom D-Bus service working
